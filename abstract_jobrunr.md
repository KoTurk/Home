<h1>Asynchronous Job Processing in Java with JobRunr</h1>

JobRunr is a Java library that helps developers offload their (long-running) tasks to the background asynchronously, increasing the application's performance.

In this session, we show you how to use the library with your application with live coding and discuss in depth how you can queue, schedule, or schedule a recurring background Job in JobRunr's JobScheduler class. 
lso, seeing that you can use a dashboard to monitor your jobs is excellent in the past or in the future.
