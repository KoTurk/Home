<h1>The Future is 💚: A Journey through the Energy Efficient Design Principles of Software Engineering</h1>

⚡️ Are you a software developer who wants to make a positive impact on the environment? ⚡️</br>
In this session, we will deep dive into the world of Green Software Engineering and give you practical tips on how to measure your application's carbon footprint and a few tactics you can apply in your applications to be more eco-friendly.

Using a practical hands-on approach, we'll dive into different layers of the application development stack, where we cover:

✅ JVM guidelines (OpenJDK HotSpot VM, Oracle GraalVM, OpenJ9, native-image, etc.) using JDK 21. We'll evaluate different application types, including Spring Boot and Quarkus-based </br>
✅ Code Guidelines (Java best practices, Code scanning with EcoSonar)</br>
✅ Architecture (Game changer -> Build Caching to reduce your build time)</br>
✅ Frontend (websitecarbon.com to measure your site)</br>

This session is a must for every software engineer who cares about the environment.

💚 Let's work together to create a greener future 💚
