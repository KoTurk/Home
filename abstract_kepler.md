<h1>From Space to Code: Using NASA's Open Data APIs with Kepler</h1>

Did you know that NASA offers a wealth of open APIs that provide access to fascinating data from across our solar system and beyond? In this session, we will explore how to use this rich data set to build applications that not only educate and inspire users but also empower them to make more sustainable choices.

We'll dive into four key areas:

1. Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) - Discover the beauty and mysteries of our universe through stunning space photography.
2. Mars Exploration - Investigate NASA's plans for future missions and the potential for human habitation on the Red Planet.
3. Exoplanet Exploration - Explore the possibilities of life on other planets and the latest discoveries.
4. Earth Observation - Analyse the data of our own earth to make discoveries if we look into the climate, environmental health, and ecosystems.

Also, we'll demonstrate how to measure the power efficiency of your applications using Kepler, a tool that helps you optimize the environmental impact of your applications..

Letâ€™s unlock the power of Kepler together with NASA's open data to forge a path towards a more environmentally-friendly future, one line of code at a time.
