<h1>Maven's Hidden Secrets and Treasures to speed up your build</h1>

Ahoy, Maven Pirates! Gather around, for I have a treasure of knowledge to share with ye salty dogs. ☠️

Ye be hearin' about this thing called 'Build Caching'? 
It’s a secret weapon that can make yer ship (build) sail faster than a seagull catchin' the wind! 💨

How does it work, ye ask? Well, add an extension to the project file in the "pom" ye mateys call it.
But don't think it's all smooth sailin' from there. Nay, ye need to do a bit of work on the pipeline too. 
Arr, we be talkin' about addin' a remote (cache) server to the settings file, 
and then ye be sayin' goodbye to them extra (rum with) coffee breaks. 🤫☕️ 

By makin' a few simple tweaks, we give yer build a mighty fine boost! And ye be learnin' all about them Maven lifecycles too! 
We will show how to improve yer tests and run them in parallel, like enterin’ a ship. 🚢⚡️ 

But hear me out, me hearties, for this be no ordinary treasure of knowledge. 
Nay, this is reserved for a select few, the likes of ye who be joinin' this session. 🤝 

So, keep yer lips sealed, and don't be tellin' a soul about this secret, aye?
