<h1>Your frontend is ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Let's measure its impact with CO2.js</h1>

Are you a software **developer**, **architect**, or **manager**, eager and ready to make a significant impact on the world?

Do you want to solve complex puzzles to make the üåé a little bit better?
Then this is your chance! </br>Let's try to fix the Climate Change problem together by taking the first steps!
How? By measuring the carbon footprint of (y)our frontend applications!

In this session, we will deep dive into the world of decreasing our CO2 emissions.</br>
The Green Web Foundation created a library to measure your coding emissions.</br>
With hands-on examples, we will explore the world of CO2.js, a practical way to measure code by
transforming bytes into (kilo) grams of CO2 emissions.

Now you're thinking, how do they measure it? By calculating the average carbon intensity of electricity, you can measure it by using the:</br>
‚ö°Ô∏è Sustainable Web Design model, that calculates the emission of data center usage, network transfer, end-user device usage, and the production of hardware</br>
‚ö°Ô∏è 1Byte model (The Cost of a Byte), that narrows the emission to a data center and network only.

After this session, you will know how to measure your coding emissions, with practical examples.

Everyone has to play a part in the climate solution! So let's do this together! üíö
